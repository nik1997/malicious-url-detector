# Malicious URL Detector chrome extension


The Malicious URL Detector chrome extension will live in your browser and every time you open a new link will check the url with the AI model trained on hundreds of urls to determine whether the url is safe or not. Then, it will alert you before you land on the page, if the url is malicious.
